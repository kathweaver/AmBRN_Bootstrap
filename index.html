            We are a fund-raising organization with the goal of assisting other non-profit beagle rescue organizations who are engaged in the work of rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming beagle dogs.
        </p>
        <p>
            We provide re-imbursement for some of the expenses involved in this work. The rescued dog must be a beagle. Funds are available only after the dog has been placed into a permanent home.&nbsp; Receiving funds from ABRN is a 2-step process.
            FIRST fill out the form "<a href="forms/ABRN ACCOUNT AP2015.docx">ABRN Account Application</a>".
            Once you have received notification that your account has been established, use the "<a href="forms/Reimbursement Form.xlsx">Request for Reimbursement</a>" form to request funds.
        </p>
        <p><strong>AmBRN is a tax exempt publicly supported organization as described under Section 501(c)(3) and 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code</strong>

        <strong>From our new President, Cathy Palmer</strong>
        <br />
        Taking over the presidency of American Beagle Relief Network after the tragic 
        loss of Julie Wright, I reflect upon all that she has contributed to this organization 
        and the entire Beagle community. With the help of the Board of Directors, 
        I will endeavor to continue Julie's commitment to helping Beagles in need. 
        <br />
        When I accepted the position of vice president, I was looking forward to working 
        and learning from a woman whose dedication to Beagles was exemplary. 
        Her mentorship to so many of us enhanced not only our own breeding programs 
        but the quality of Beagles in general. Filling her shoes is an impossible task, 
        but my commitment to continuing her legacy will be my motivation in this role. 
        My thoughts and condolences go out to all of Julie's friends and family. 
        <br />She will be missed. 
        </p>

         <strong>Memorial Web Site started</strong>
         <br />
        by Kathleen Weaver, Webmaster
        <br />
        Julie and I had been talking about creating a Memorial web site for the American Beagle Relief Network, but due to several life circumstances I wasn't able to get it past the started state.  As a tribute to Julie, I am starting that effort again.  At first, it will be completely manual.
        In order to create a memorial, please click on the donate button and write your memorial in the donation comments. You can email a photo to the webmaster, link on the right, and it will be included. Memorials can be made for both advocates of the breed or any dog who has made contributions to the breed, both in conformation, producing puppies, or in performance events.
        Multiple donations towards the memorial will move the memorial higher in the list.
