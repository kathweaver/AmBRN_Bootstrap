	   <p class="MsoNormal">
	   We hope you will enjoy this newsletter to update you on the activities of the 
	   American Beagle Relief Network. Known as 'AmBrNet', we were established 
	   on August 14, 2013 to take over the work previously done by the Beagle 
	   Rescue Foundation of America (BRFOA), which is no longer in existence. We 
	   are a non-profit organization that raises funds primarily from the show 
	   beagle community to benefit beagle rescue organizations across the USA. 
	   None of our officers or volunteers are paid. With the exception of very 
	   modest operating costs, nearly 100% of contributions go directly to other 
	   non-profit organizations to help with their costs to rescue and re-home 
	   needy beagles. </p>
	   <p class="MsoNormal">

	   <h3 align="center"><strong>IT'S OFFICIAL - WE ARE NOW 501 (c) 3!</strong></h3>
	   <p>
	   We are pleased to announce that as of May 28, 2014, the American Beagle 
	   Relief Network has been officially recognized by the Internal Revenue 
	   Service as a 501 (c) 3 Non-Profit, Tax Exempt organization. We have been 
	   classified as a public charity under IRS guidelines. This means that 
	   contributions to AmBrNet are tax-deductible as charitable donations. This 
	   deduction is available retro-actively for all contributions that have 
	   been made since our inception on August 14, 2013. We are also qualified 
	   to receive tax-deductible transfers, bequests and gifts.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	   <p class="MsoNormal">
	   <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>We 
	   were able to obtain this approval on our first application primarily due 
	   to the efforts of CPA, Diane Piccioni, who went through the application 
	   for us with a fine-tooth comb to be sure we provided all of the 
	   documentation needed for IRS. Dennis Dollar also provided valuable legal 
	   advice from his viewpoint as an attorney. The majority of the $450 filing 
	   fee was also donated by a benefactor who has asked to remain annonymous. 
	   We are deeply grateful to all who helped make this possible. AmBrNet is 
	   now ready to grow and improve in our efforts to raise funds to help 
	   rescue needy beagles across the USA.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	   <h3 align="center">   <strong>AmBrNet HOLDS IT'S FIRST ANNUAL NBC SPECIALTY AUCTION</strong><br>	   </h3>
		   By Julie Wright, President<br><br>
		   
			   It was with some trepidation that we prepared for our first 
			   AmBrNet NBC Auction. While I had worked on many previous BRFOA 
			   auctions, and been in charge of the previous 2, we had a whole 
			   new group of people, a new venue and many new elements in play as 
			   we approached our first AmBrNet live Auction on November 1st, 
			   2013 in Tucson. Show Chair, Patricia Siefried and banquet chair, 
			   Sue Sammarco organized a dinner buffet that was delicious with 
			   about 85 people attending. Thanks to many generous donations, we 
			   had a great variety of items for people to bid on in both the 
			   silent and live auctions....the auctions raised close to $6,000. 
			   This year we had the new and wonderful phenomena of several 
			   people 'jumping on the bandwagon' with additional fund-raising 
			   efforts. Jane Catz and Erich Brandt took over our table in the 
			   show room and sold $1,000 worth of AmBrNet logo'd T-shirts and 
			   Sweatshirts. The Southern California Beagle Club held a fun match 
			   that raised another $150 for AmBRNet and Annette Didier hosted a 
			   jewelry party that brought in another $125. So the total funds 
			   raised was in excess of $7,000. &nbsp;None of this would have been 
			   possible without the help of dozens of people in many different 
			   capacities.
			   <br><br>
	  <p align="center"> <img  src="http://www.ambrn.org/Newsletter/2014_June/images/AuctionCollage.png"><br></p>
	  
			   We would like to thank Jana and Patrick Rodes of All Around Farms 
			   who sponsored the t-shirts. We still have plenty of shirts to 
			   sell. All of the money goes directly to benefit beagle rescue 
			   because the sponsors paid for the printing of the shirts. It 
			   really has taken a village to get AmBRNet going. Our Treasurer, 
			   Jessica Parker, has set up our banking, eBay and Pay Pal accounts 
			   and handles the day to day tracking of payments for our on-going 
			   auctions and fund-raising. Jaye Marten, as Secretary, is handling 
			   our correspondence. Our Vice-President, Cathy Palmer worked hard 
			   all through the auction process in Tucson, helping with our data 
			   entry, check in, and check out, as did Mike Simpson and Trish 
			   Pittman. We used online software this year to enable us to keep 
			   better track of the auction. We learned a lot from this trial run 
			   that we are hoping will make future auctions more efficient as 
			   well as fun. Richard Hilton and Jennifer Arthington kept the 
			   bidding and laughter going throughout the live auction. Sarah Lee 
			   has helped create our forms as well as solving any software 
			   issues that came up. Kathleen Weaver has created and is 
			   maintaining and updating our website at:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ambrn.org/">AmBRN.org</a>&nbsp;as 
			   well as publishing our newsletter.</div>
		   
			   <br>
		   
			   <br>
			   The entire show beagle community has been awesome with their 
			   support of AmBRNet. As the 4th most popular breed in the United 
			   States, the need for rescue is great. To be honest, at our 
			   current level, the help that we provide is just a 'drop in the 
			   bucket' compared to the need that is out there. However, every 
			   bit of help counts to the beagles who need rescue and re-homing. 
			   The level of commitment to this cause among beagle breeders has 
			   been very encouraging. It is my hope that as we explore new 
			   fund-raising avenues, we will be able to have an increasingly 
			   meaningful impact on beagle rescue. Please feel free to share 
			   your ideas for our future fund raising as well as ways to grow 
			   this organization.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;

	   <h3 align="center"><strong>An Interview with Linda Forrest of SOS Beagle Rescue</strong></h3>
	   <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><em>
	   SOS 
	   Beagle Rescue is one of the oldest rescues currently operating in the 
	   United States. They are typical of the organizations that AmBrNet helps. 
	   In this interview, it's founder, Linda Forrest, gives us a glimpse of the 
	   work they do and how they operate.</em><o:p><br><br></o:p></span>SOS Beagle Rescue began our efforts in 1991.  After 18 years of showing and breeding  beagles, I became aware of animal rights activists in NJ who were proposing an  inclusive spay/neuter law with $500 registration fees for intact animals.  Other members of my all-breed club and I  attended some of their meetings to hear their arguments.  Trying to disprove some of the statistics that  the animal rights group were stating (with no sources noted), I decided to do a  survey of my local shelter, tracking every animal that came into the shelter in  a 30 day period.<br>
	    
    <p>I had the  misconception that most purebreds in shelters were there because of severe  behavioral problems or medical problems that would make them unsuitable as pets.  Why would someone pay good money for a  purebred dog only to give it up to a shelter?&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>	    I set some parameters: defining adoptable as under 9 with  no known medical or aggression issues.   With that guideline, I determined that of the 380 animals turned into  the shelter in that one month, 50% were dogs and 25% of those (about 50)  appeared to be purebred.  About half of  these were reclaimed by owners or adopted and 10% were euthanized because of  age or temperament.&nbsp; <br>
	    Many of the dogs in the shelter that month were extremely  friendly; many who were surrendered were known to be housebroken and up to date  on all their shots.  These dogs deserved  new homes. I wondered what I could do to help?   I decided to champion the beagle that was at the shelter at that time by  posting flyers at work and vets offices. Through these efforts, I was able to  refer someone in to adopt him in time.</p>
	  <p>When I returned to the shelter two days later, there were 3  new beagles there that had been in the shelter for a period of time that had  passed their legal stray hold.  The  shelter was full and they had been there the longest.  If Animal Control brought in any dogs  overnight, these beagles would be the first 3 destroyed the next morning.&nbsp; <br>
	    </p>
	  <p>They were my first three rescues, going home with me that  evening.  We started slow, with about 36  adoptions that first year, increasing slightly each year. Initially surrender  calls outnumbered adoptions 10 to 1.  By  1994, in just the first 6 months, we had taken 250 surrender calls on beagles  and we decided to incorporate and obtain our 501c3 status and expand our  efforts.  By 1996, rescue was consuming  my time and I stepped away from showing and breeding beagles.<br>
	    </p>
	  <p>SOS now has 3 chapters: one in Birmingham, AL, another in  Knoxville, TN, and our base in Atco, NJ.   Our NJ chapter covers primarily the Greater Philadelphia and Northern NJ  area, with occasional dogs from NY.  Our  AL chapter operates mostly independently of us and covers from Mobile to  Birmingham.  Our TN chapter works with 16  high kill shelters within a 60-mile radius of Knoxville and is always full.  They send 90% of their dogs to our NJ chapter for placement, as most TN  adopters are looking for a new &ldquo;hunting dog.&rdquo; The only thing we want our dogs  to hunt is the couch.  We are lucky that  we&rsquo;ve been able to put many southern shelters in touch with northern rescues as  partners. These shelters typically each run a transport each month. Sometimes  the dogs are transported via a volunteer &ldquo;pony-express&rdquo; which runs up the I-81  corridor. Each driver transports the dogs 80-100 miles along the way, passing  them off to the next volunteer for the next leg of their journey. By partnering  with the shelters on their monthly transports, we are able to send some of our  beagles along at greatly reduced costs.<br>
	    </p>
	  <p>In 2012, our AL chapter placed 65 beagles, while TN and NJ  placed a total of 194 for a total of 259 beagles.  Many of our adopters are now returning for  their 3rd and 4th dogs from SOS Beagles.  I&rsquo;m proud of our numbers since we have only 7  foster homes in the NJ area.  We could  easily double our placement numbers each year if we had more foster homes. <br>
	    </p>
	  <p>Every dog has its story. Here are some recent ones that are  of special interest;<br>
	    </p>
	  <p>Just recently our TN director, Beth, was called on a litter  of day-old puppies abandoned in a spay/neuter parking lot with their  mother.  A note, written on the back of a  cardboard pastry box, said the puppies were purebred and that they couldn&rsquo;t  care for them.  The spay/neuter clinic  director called Beth and asked for assistance.  Now 11 weeks old, all have found homes: 4 in  Tennessee and 3 in NJ.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="http://www.ambrn.org/Newsletter/2014_June/images/DespicableMe.jpg" alt="" width="500"/><br>
    </p>
	  <p>Another recent case was that of an owner who had intact dogs  that continued to reproduce.  They were  keeping 7 adult beagles, a pregnant 11 month old, and a litter of 5 week old  pups in one outdoor kennel run, tossing food into the pen for a  free-for-all.  We have since gotten 5 of  the adults, the 11 mo. old pregnant girl and the 3 puppies into new homes. We  also had the remaining two dogs spayed/neutered for the owners.</p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="http://www.ambrn.org/Newsletter/2014_June/images/iCarly.jpg" alt="" width="500"/><br>
    </p>
	  <p>A year or two ago, we were contacted by a shelter in the  Lenoir City, TN area who had a female beagle there.  When we checked on her, we noted her classic  looks and lack of front dewclaws. We e-mailed Julie Fulkerson of Fulmont  beagles who lives in Lenoir City to see if she had any leads.  Lo and behold, it was a show bitch who had  escaped from the owner&rsquo;s yard several weeks before.  We were able to reunite her with her grateful  owners.<br>
	    </p>
	  <p>In early 2013, we took into foster care a little girl named  Lark.  Lark was a hungry, dirty, flea-ridden beagle who was  found by the side of the road in Tennessee by a kind couple. She had a bad  limp, and they thought she had been hit by a car, but she had no sign of recent  injuries. They took the young beagle home and cleaned her up. The husband fell  in love with her and wanted to keep her, but they had no income and knew she  needed veterinary help. They posted on Craig's List looking for a Good  Samaritan. They agreed to meet any rescuer at the vet's. At that point, SOS  Beagle Rescue, Tennesse, stepped up to the plate! Lark was evaluated by our vet  to see just what, if anything, could be done to help correct what turned out to  be a serious double knee issue she had probably had since birth. Unlike the  normal case of luxating patella, her knee caps are <em>outside the knee</em>,  forcing both knees to fold in. She had low muscle tone and very poor mobility.  As Dr. Hackett said, we sure brought him a challenging case!  She had surgery on her left knee first. The  femur had some scarring but there was absolutely no groove to hold the knee cap  in place.  Her second surgery was about 6  weeks later on her right rear leg. A deep groove was cut into the smooth area  and the kneecap was anchored in place. Pretty amazing to see. After both  surgeries, Lark was trying to walk within 2 days, showing us that she had been  in pretty severe pain initially.  This  tiny 9 lb girl has found a forever home in NJ and has filled out at about 14#  and will now have a long and pain free life!&nbsp;</p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="http://www.ambrn.org/Newsletter/2014_June/images/Lark2.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt=""/><br>
    </p>
	  <p>SOS considers spays/neuters to be one of the most important  vet costs we incur.  The assistance we&rsquo;ve  received from the BRFOA has helped us to delegate some of our funds to take on  some heartworm positive dogs and special needs dogs while allowing us to keep  our adoption fees in line with local shelters so that more dogs can be adopted.  We are glad that AmBRNet is continuing the fund raising and assistance that  BRFOA has done in the past and look forward to working with AmBRNet in the  future.&nbsp;</p>
