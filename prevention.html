I've written the articles, I was the owner and trainer of U-CDX Weaver's Peppermint Patty UDX, Bettner's Byte O Magic AX OAJ AXP AJP,
Maggie OA OAJ NAP NJP, currently have two beagles, Macy and Dulce.  Both dog agility and Dulce is a diabetes alert dog.  Patty was a therapy dog, and I 
have done police dog training.
</p>
<p>
My training philosophy is to prevent problems rather than correcting them.  For example, for house training I will give the pup only supervised access to the house,
keeping them in a dog safe area when I can't.  My favorite is an extremely large crate, the largest made.  I don't punish them for making mistakes, as I make it
very sure that they can't make them.

      <p>Both breeders and rescuers may find the need to rehome a dog. Family emergencies come up, people die, and sometimes things don't work out.  Both breeders and rescuers should be prepared to take dogs back and have it written in their contracts.</p>
      <p>I had a dog several years ago that just didn't fit in our family.  I took in a dog from a rescue organization that just didn't fit in, even with all our best efforts. He was making an existing dog miserable. It took us 6 months to give up, and I should have sooner.</p>
      <p>It was a win-win situation though, as the dog ended up in a home where he was much happier and we ended up with a second dog who was happy with us.</p>
      <p>My own beagle breeder has taken back dogs and rehome them. She even takes in local rescue dogs and finds home from them. All things I personally look for in a breeder.</p>
      <p>Also, don't forget to make some type of provision for the dogs you currently have in your home. Something very well could happen to you, and you do need to make provisions for that, both breeders, rescuers and pet owners.</p>

    <p>The most important than for any dog to learn, especially a beagle is to come when it is calls. You should never call a dog and then punish it. Coming to you should always be rewarded.</p>
    <p>Here is what you need to teach any dog to come to you when it is called:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Soft, easy to chew treats</li>
      <li>A long line -- do not use a retractable lead, use as long a leash as possible</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Start with short distances, let the dog get distracted, then call the dog's name, show him the treat and move in the opposite direction.  All of this is designed to get the dog's attention and to get them to move towards you.  Reward the dog with one small treat as soon as they are close to you. Having them sit near you makes it easier to grab them but isn't entirely necessarily.</p>
    <p>Repeat often. Repeat in as many places as possible.  Use as many distractions as possible. Having food really helps.</p>
    <p>If you have training partners, you can do this in a group, and have different people call the dog. This can be a game for the entire family.</p>
    <p>I would still make sure the dog is on a long line -- see the article about <a href="offleash.html">off leash beagles</a>. Even if you have a perfect recall, I still don't let my beagles off leash.<br>

	  <p>In a word, don't.</p>
	  <p>I have been training beagles in obedience and agility for many years. I had the Number One Obedience beagle in the 90's according to the National Beagle Club and many other rankings.</p>
	  <p>She was rarely allowed off leash. One day I had her in my truck, the windows were open and we were traveling through the Vicksburg National Park and she spotted a squirrel. She went right through the open window. Fortunately I had her on a 6 foot leash and was able to grab it and hit the brakes at the same time, with no one worse for wear after the incident except for my nerves.</p>
	  <p>She had an excellent recall but she also had the other thing our beagles are bred with: &quot;prey drive&quot;.</p>
	  <p>My best agility beagle had a bad habit of going walk about. About once a year she would decide to find her way out of our fence and go exploring. She never could find her way back herself, and always managed to find a neighbor to help her. The moral of that story is to not only make sure you don't let your beagles off leash, but have them fully tagged and microchipped so they can be returned to you.</p>
	  <p>There are several GPS devices on the market that work very well if you have trouble with an escape artist.</p>

        <h2 id="stealing">Stealing</h2>

      <p>
          Yes, beagles will steal.  I currently have one that will move the kitchen chairs around so 
          she can get up on the counters.  
      </p>
      <p>
          The best way to keep beagles from stealing is to prevent it.  Don't leave your beagle in the kitchen unattended when 
          there is food on the counters.  We've gone so far as to install baby gates in key places so we don't have to worry
          about what the beagles are up to.
      </p>
    <p>
        And yes, there is a theme here -- it's much easier to control your behavior, than the beagle's behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
          Example:  My husband and I were eating in the living room with the dogs, he decided to get up and do something and left
        his salad behind.  Yes, both beagles were immediately in the plate, and yelling at them did no good.  On the other hand,
        I remember to take my plate with me, saving it from the beagles.
