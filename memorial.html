    <h5><em>Julie and I been talking about creating a Memorial web site for the American Beagle Relief Network,
            but due to several life circumstances I wasn't able to get it past the started state.
             As a tribute to Julie, I am starting that effort again.  At first, it will be completely manual.

Although many of Jane’s beagles, known as Terwillegar Beagles became leading show dogs, more importantly they became members of dozens of families. Her care for her Beagles and the families they were placed with resulted in a network of friends who also became addicted to these loveable, family pets. Jane joined her family of beagles in heaven earlier this year, so please donate to the Beagle rescue in Jane’s memory to help continue her passion of providing homes for these wonderful pets.</p>
